INTRODUCTION. 

fjlijt HIS edition of the Bhagavad-Gitd has been prepared for 
pl[A the use of those who, while studying this Hindu scrip- 
gjj^g ture mainly for the sake of its priceless teachings, wish, 
being little acquainted with Samskrit, to utilise the text, thus 
gaining a fuller insight into the meaning than can be gained 
through a translation, and incidentally acquiring a better 
knowledge of that language also. A brief note on the grammar 
of Samskrit, putting before the reader a few of the most 
salient features thereof, is therefore added here, as likely to 
be of use. It will help by giving a bird's eye view of the 
subject and thus some idea of how one part is connected with 
another. The details must of course be looked up in any large 
grammar, if needed. 

/. Alphabet : A complete alphabet would comprise hun- 
dreds, perhaps thousands, of single sounds. Out of these each 
human race or sub-race uses a comparatively small number, 
selected in accordance with the constitution of its vocal organs 
and of other aspects of its physical and superphysical being. 
There is a correspondence between all the parts of an organism; 
and the means and instruments of manifestation possessed by 
a race or nation, as by an individual, are, generally speaking, 
in correspondence with the 'ruling passion,' the 'main idea,' 
which that race or nation embodies and has to express. These 
'ideas,' 'passions,' 'emotions,' 'glories,' 'aspects,' 'modifications,' 



of the Universal Self, Spirit, or Consciousness, are infinite ; 
the world-process which endeavours to express them is infinite. 
One main idea ( others being subordinate ) is expressed by one 
individual, or one race, in any one time and space, 'beauty', 
'strength,' 'comfort', 'peace,' 'war', 'science,' 'law', 'duty' 
'right,' 'piety,' 'devotion,' &c. &c. The various members of a 
race, which is the embodiment and exponent of any one such main 
idea, have to use means of communication with each other to 
intensify that exposition, to make their lives fuller and deeper. 
This means, during the present cycle of evolution, is sound- 
language. In other cycles it may be sight-language, or touch- 
language, or smell-language, &c. &c. This sound-language is 
made up of single sounds, which, as said before, are in 
accordance with the 'body,' the physical constitution, of the 
race, which, again, is in accordance with its 'spirit,' its ruling 
idea. A race embodying sweetness and gentleness would un- 
consciously select the soft and sweet sounds for its language; 
another manifesting martial strength and spirit, the harsher 
and more definite ones. 

The Samskrit language, embodying Dharma, law and 
order, the instrument of a civilisation whose characteristics 
are systematisation, rounded comprehensiveness and complete- 
ness, an ordered arrangement of life from beginning to end, 
and in all departments, is therefore itself systematic. It uses 
fourteen vowels and thirty-five consonants, a total of seven sevens. 
Some put the nasal and the aspirate sounds anitsvdra and 
: visarga amongst the vowels, and so count them as sixteen and 
the consonants thirty-three. They are arranged systematically, 
according to the regions of the vocal apparatus whence they pro- 
ceed, as gutturals, linguce-radicals, palatals, cerebrals, dentals, 



labials, and certain combinations of these beginning from the 
throat and proceeding outwards. As to why we have here two 
septenaries of vowels and five septenaries of consonants is a 
question which could possibly be answered by one who had suffici- 
ent knowledge of world-evolution to be able to say why the present 
human race has two hands and two feet and five senses of 
knowledge and five organs of action, and five fingers on each 
hand and five toes on each foot, &c. The question can only 
tantalise us. But we can vaguely see that if these sounds of 
the Samskrit alphabet were multiplied systematically and 
permuted and combined, we should obtain a scheme which would 
cover all the languages of the earth, and bring into line all the 
verv various-seeming sounds which constitute the several 
alphabets of these. F. i., taking the linguce-radicals, qy, %T, ^ 
5 r . we find that ?jf, is the aspirate of eft, that the guttural of 
this ?ci, viz, ij(, kh, has been appropriated by the Persian race 
and language and has disappeared from Samskrit; that T, is 
only a deepening of 37; and that ^ is the* aspirate of T; that the 
guttural of ZRI. e., q, and of T, '. e., h, again, huve disappe- 
ared from Samskrit and been appropriated by the Arabic race 
and language; that fF, is the nasal ofT, as now pronounced, and 
that the nasals of the other letters, gj, ??r, ^ &c., &c., are not 
present in Samskrit, but may possibly be present in some of 
the so-called savage languages, as ' snorts ' and 'grunts' of 
various kinds. 

This process of elimination, ot the disappearance of sounds 
and letters, may be witnessed as being in progress even to-day. In 
Samskrit the vowels ^j. ^, r, 5C- have practically disappeared from 
use ; their outer written form is preserved, but for all practical 
purposes of pronunciation they have merged into * and 5T. 



[ iv ] 

The distinction between sj and q is on the wane ; the probability, 
judging by the rules of pronunciation given by Pinini, is that q 
in another form of the Persian kh mentioned above, as the 
discarded ^ SR is that of the Arabic q and the similarly 
abandoned^q 1 of the Persian ph or f. 

The nasal letters again g^, sy, or, *J, have a tendency to run, 
all of them, into the single ^, in the mouths of those who are not 
particularly careful. So in English, sounds which originally 
existed when such words as 'daughter' (Persian dukhtar, Samskrit 
duhita), and 'night' ( Samskrit nakta ) &c. were brought over, 
have now disappeared except perhaps in some village dialect?, 
though the spelling continues as before. The reason of this may 
be suggested thus. According to the variety of the aspects of 
consciousness embodied in a people will be the variety of sounds, 
or letters employed by them; as the one variety dimini- 
shes or expands so will the other : if the word laugh were 
pronounced as lawgh as it probably was in the beginning, and as 
it is still by 'uneducated' people, it would imply a greater and a 
somewhat coarser heartiness ; pronounced as laf it indicates a 
toning down of the uncontrolled animal spirit, into a much 
more mild and refined condition of feeling. In America, and in 
some English circles, it is becoming further shortened into Ian'.

reference to ??nT and STOsT, the 



T IT af * 



' place ' in the vocal apparatus 
and the special kind of ' effort ' 
required to pronounce it. 



There are only a few verses now current, as to the psycho- 
physics of sound and language, in Panini's Shikshd, and these are 
not very intelligible in the absence of full explanations. They 
may be summarised thus : The Self cognising facts by means of 
the Buddhi ( Reason ) inspires the Manas ( intelligence ) with 
the desire to speak ; the Manas strikes the Ttdydgni the fire 
of the body ; and it in turn sets in motion the mdruta, the wind 
or breath that moving in the chest generates the Mandra 
sound ; that, again, rising to the palate ( or the crown 
of the head ) and rebounding thence passes to the mouth and 
produces articulate sounds, classified according to tone, time, 
place, effort, &c., &c. 

II. Sandhi or Coalescence of sounds or letters In connection 
with these letter sounds, arises the first difficulty of Samskrit 
Grammar, Sandhi, the coalescence of sounds. When one word 
is followed by another, in quick succession of pronunciation, the 
natural tendency is for the tail of the first and the head of the 
second to get mixed up : This mixture sometimes takes a shape 
which, while no doubt always retaining traces of the compo- 



nents, is not always analy sable into these components by the 
beginner. The coalescence takes place in all languages, and 
offers one of the chief difficulties to the foreigner; but in 
other languages, for the most part, no attempt is made to 
express in writing the spoken sound. Thus the Frenchman 
says "le'pti," but he always writes ' le petit. " In Samskrit 
writing the spoken sound is imitated. The detailed rules on 
this subject, which two sounds mixing make up which third 
sound, are many. The generalised rule may be stated to be that 
if the student will pronounce the two letters correctly and 
quickly in succession, the resultant sound, compelled by his own 
vocal apparatus, will also be in accordance with the grammati- 
cal rule on the subject. Briefly, the grammatical rule is only a 
description of the physiological fact. This appears not only in 
the case of actual coalescence, but in the influence of one sound 
on another separated from it by one or more intervening ones. 
Thus, according to the ordinary rule the word tfJT declined into 
its instrumental form, should be *I%T, but after pronouncing 
the cerebral r in its exact Samskrit shade, the vocal apparatus 
of the Indian finds it diflicult to adjust iteelf rapidly to pro- 
nounce the dental-nasal n f properly, even when another la- 
bial nasal m intervenes ; it turns more readily to the allied 
and nearer cerebral-nasal n, % and the result is q^oF. 

Examples : 

(a.) Conjunction of similar rowels : whether both short 
or both long, or one short and one long, the resultant is the 
long vowel. 

^%?T ^TZP =?i?Rr*f: ( "i. 18. ), ^TcH 
( vi. 5. ), =ET 3rrc = =ErHTC ( iv. 27. ) ; and so with 



[ vii ] 

: (xv. 8.), g 3??rar:=?ipra: (x. 4.) etc, 
(b) Conjunction of dissimilar vowels : ST or SH followed by f 
or f gives IT, q^ ^ = ^%^ ( ii. 41, ) ; by 3 or g> gives aft, SJijfqr 
3^rT: = 5 5rer%^: ( vi. 37. ) ; by q- or q- gives ^, ^ <J^ = ^t (ii. 
38.) ; by SR gives 3T^,t?T 3jffq:=^f^: (ii. 13.) ; by ^r or ^Jr 
gives afr; f followed by any dissimilar vowel gives 2 

l ( ii. 57. ); so * gives 3r and % 
( c ) Visarga : changes in five ways ; it disappears, 

: ( i. 1. ) 5 ifc is dropped before a vowel 

and no further change occurs, ^fpr IT =^R ^^: ( i- 37. ); 
it changes into 5T, ^ and ^r, f : ^rt = ^^rt ( iv - 8. ), 



( xvii. 7. ) ; it changes into afr, 3: *ff = % ^j ( vi. 30. ), 3T5f 
STfT = ar^Tfq' (iv. 6.) these cases being generally marked with s. 
as 9: ^r*pr = ^tS^?T ( iv 9. ) ] ; it is changed into ^ , qrf^: H?- 
^^=^[^9^51 ( xiv. 3. ) The details of the rules causing 
these changes must be sought in a grammar. 

(d) Consonants'. The final consonant of one word is modified 
by the first consonant of the succeeding one. These changes 
are very numerous and intricate, and will only gradually be- 
come familiar; the following cases show the general principle 
above mentioned that the writing follows the sound ; m^ 
?T^r = Z^fr^T (vii. 2.), Zl^^rlf%^:mH?l=2I?Tff^mTl (x. 41.), 
^ =q- = ^^(.x. 39. ) 

III. Compounds. When all cases of simple sandhi have 
been eliminated, the student is faced with another difficulty ; 
words are compounded together, and only the last word of 
the compound is complete ; the remaining word or words have 
their endings clipped off, and these have to be supplied before 



[ viii ] 

the compound becomes intelligible. Such compounds are 
called snrra". They are of six chief kinds. 

f^ compounds ; tfT: =ETf si: ^tr^nff^T (Hi. 34. )j 
T %5^T: ^ = TW^R^i'TrS^r 1 ( i- 13. ) 
compounds ^9Rre f*r = 3^T ( xi. 45. ) ; 

: ( xi. 14. ) 

Compounds; qw STRHT-TOTW ( xv-17 ) 

Compounds ; 
Compounds 
fiwr %^: ?I^ rT?l = jBrgr^f^?lV ( vi. 28. ) 

Compounds ; ^HeHH: R^zj = ! ?P^rciT I I I 
To solve these compounds it will be noticed that a know- 
ledge of case-endings is necessaiy ; it is the case-ending which is 
struck out in a compound, and the meaning of the compound 
depends on this elimisated case-ending. Hence the next step 
of the learner is to familiarise himself with the case-endings, 
of which every noun has twenty-one 7 cases in 3 numbers, 
singular, dual and plural. 

]V. Words. (a) Declension of nouns. Words are mainly of 
two kinds, names of things and names of actions, corresponding 
respectively to the cognition and action aspects of conscious- 
ness. Mediating between the two, binding them together, 
as desire binds cognition and action, is the third kind of word, 
the preposition ; it forms a separate word in the modern lang- 
uages, for various evolutionary reasons ; but in the Samskrit, 
it is hidden in and is a part of the noun itself, in the shape of 
the declensional termination, even a> desire is hidden in theper- 
son. the actor, and is not something separate from him. Other 



[ ix ] 

parts of speech are off-shoots from these three principal ones. 
Nouns including pronouns are ( i ") simple, subdivided by 
gender into 3 classes, or Cii) derivative, i. e. to say, derived 
from verb-roots. Of course one theory, and probably the 
right one, is that all names or nouns are ultimately connected 
with and founded on some characteristic action of the object ; 
but without going into.the detail of the theory, it is enough for 
practical purposes to recognise that as the Samskrit language 
now stands, some of its nouns may be regarded as, on their 
face, simple and some as derivative. To denote the kind 
of relation that exists between one noun and another, and 
also to give some indication of the kind of action passing 
between them, is the purpose of prepositional, or declensional, 
terminations. As pre-positions, distinguishing and separating 
marks of the kinds of the nouns concerned, showing the position 
or situation or case in which they are, whether nominative, or 
accusative, or instrumental, &c., with reference to each other, 
these declensional terminations are called vibTtaktis', as indicat- 
ing that some action passes between them, they are called 
kdral'as. 

Examples of declensions : 

1st. ^TTSP [v. i.] 3>fr [v. 1] qrenr* [v. 4] 

2nd. ^T [i. 21] srfc^k [xi. 6] STHfiHi [xi. 32] 

3rd. 5%or [i- 3] srtrani VI-' [xi. 53]

6th. <*r*** [v. 14] 3%: [iii. 34] $iw* [i, 3] 

7th. n3r [i. 21] STOP [i. 21] ?pt<* [iii- 28] 



Atma, crude form Atman, is a typical form, and occurs 
very frequently in the Gttd in the singular number. 

1st. 3rr?*rr [ v. 21 ] 

2nd. -4| | cHT*T?[ [ vi. 5 ] 

O J r e i 

ora. ^rr^r^r | vi. & j 

4th. 
5th. 

6th. irr^: [ vi. 6 ] 

7th. 3Tfc*TPT [vi. 21] 

Neuter nouns in their case-endings, except in those of 
the first and second cases, generally follow the masculine. 

Thus aw crude form 3t*fe, has : 



1st. eJ>M (xviii. 8) SRnT F ^FTfTT ( ix. 9 ) 
2nd. ( iii. 8) ( vi. 30 ) 

The feminine in f may be taken as an example of the 
feminine declensions t 

1st. if^ ( xviii. 78) 

2nd. $T<g ( iii. 2 ) 

3rd. f^-STT ( ii- 39 ) 

4th. Jrfr or JTrTO 

5th. f^r: ( iii. 43 ) or f %&i: 
6th. 

7th. ^r ( ii, 49 ) 

(6) Adjectives and adverbs *c. Adjectives, words indica- 
tive of the ' qualities ' of nouns, are declined in the same way 
as the latter, and when not compounded with these are always 
in " apposition " with them. 



[ xi ] 

Adverbs are mostly ' Indeclinable ' in Samsferit. These 
indeclinables include also some words, however, which are not 
adverbs ; thus conjunctions and interjections are included here. 
Examples ^, 3TR 



T, &c., &c., are of frequent occurrence. 

(c) Gender. The marks of gender are very perplexed in 
Samskrit : They belong to the noun only, as in most languages ; 
and not the verb, as in Hindi, Arabic or French. As a 
general rule, governing frequent cases, when the male base ends 
in a short 3T, the corresponding female base ends in the long 
aqrr ; and the neuter in ^j. 

^PTC: Singular of 3T7*R[. ( xvi-14 ) 
8T7JT ( i". 6 ) ; STTt ( iv- 4 ). 

(d) Verbs. After nouns, verbs. The list of roots given by 
Panini numbers 2343; and eacb is capable of undergoing 
hundreds of inflectional or conjugational terminations, on 
account of moods and tenses, and causative, desiderative and 
repetitive forms of it, and all these again can be conjugated in 
the active or the passive form, and so on. But by the same pro- 
cesses of selection and elimination that have governed the number 
of the letters, the verb-roots in actual use in current Samskrit 
are not many more than 500 and of these a very limited number 
of forms is used. 

The tenses and moods are taken together and all called 
ribhaJctts or laMras ; and there are ten of such, viz., six tenses 
and four moods. The tenses are, 1 present; 3 past; and 2 
future; and the moods are Imperative, Potential, Benedictive and 



[ xii ] 

Conditional. In common and unclassical Samskrit, one form 
of the past, viz ., the first preterite, is largely used, the other two 
being very infrequent ; so the first future is seldom met with even 
in cla ssical Samskrit. Of the moods, the benedictive mood is 
very rarely used. 

If the whole list of the 2343 roots were; carefully examined, 
very many more roots would be found to be common between 
the several Aryan languages than are now noted. But, as said 
before in connection with the alphabet, the genius of each later 
janguage has selected out of the roots what were most suited to 
it, and the older race, the root-race, ihas correspondingly dropped 
them in its later career. It is as if there had been a partition 
of patrimony between heirs so that what one took the others 
could not retain. 

These verbs are divided into ten classes ; the external rea- 
son is that the verbs of each class resemble each other more than 
those of the other classes, in the general appearance of their 
conjugational formp. But this again requires a deeper why; 
and that is not traceable. If it could be said that there were ten 
main kinds of human action, we should have approximated to 
the answer wanted. 

There are two main forms of conjugation, the q"^-tff "for 
another '' ; and the 3TR J R-7? " for self '. The former, generally 
speaking, belongs to the active voice, wherein one person does 
something to another ; and the latter to the passive voice, where- 
in something is done ' to one self '. But while in the passive 
voice form of any verb only the 3flcH%T? form is used, in 
the active voice the TWT7? f rm is used only generally, and 
^sometimes the 3TR*Rf? form is used, and in some cases both.

In the technical woi-ks on grammar, rules are given for 
the correct use of all the ten moods and tenses ; thus the first 
preterite should be nsed when the event is older than the 
current day ; the 2nd when it occurred outside the speaker's 
personal knowledge ; and the 3rd in any case; and so the 1st 
future should be used when the event is expected very shortly. 
But these rules, as said before, are observed only in classical 
composition. There is also some reason to think that they do not 
represent accurately the real original distinctions. It is 
possible that the three pasts corresponded to the English 
' imperfect ' and ' pluperfect ' &c. 

The addition of prefixes entirely changes the meaning 
of the verb-root, as stated in the classical shloka on the 
subject. 



" The prefex violently drags away elsewhere the meaning 
of the verb-root thus, with the common root 5, to take away, 
S^n: means a blow, -STT^TC food, ?ferc destruction f%frc, play, and 
^ft^pc clearing away ". A careful analysis shows that the idea of 
taking away is present in some shape or other throughout all these. 



Each verb-root is capable of being modified into a causative 
form, a desiderative form and a frequentative form ; and each 
of these forms is capable of independent conjugation in all 
moods and tenses. 

Causative ; The causative verb is formed by the addition 
of ?, which becomes when the termination is added, q 
vjiH^fiii ( ii. 21 ) he causes to kill, from ^ to kill ; ftqrsram 
(iii. 1) thou causest (me) to engage, from *r to join; 
3iPJ% (iii- 5) he is caused to do, from $ to do ; f^ff^- 
qq; ( iii. 29 ) he may cause to be unsettled, from ^w to move ; 
STfEff^?! let ' him ) cause to sink down, from ^T^?; to be cast 
down. 

Desiderative; The desiderative verb expresses the wish 
of the agent ; ^r is added, and the first letter is reduplicated 

( i. i) wishing to fight, from 5^ to fight; 
: (ii. 6 ) ( we ) wish to live, from H\^ to live; 
( iii. 25 ) desiring to do, from f to do ; sjNj^jSfr: ( of the ) 
wishing to ascend, from ^Jl^tomount. 

(e ) Derivative words. Derivative words of various kinds, 
e, a. some indicating moods not covered by the regular conju- 
gations, are formed by means of affixes. 

( ?^S ) ^T 1 ^ = ( wis h ) to obtain ( xii. 9 ). 

S = ( art powerless ) to do ( xii. 11 ). 
= having abandoned ( V. 10 ). 
having been ( ii. 20 ). 
Various participles, past, present and future, and some 
shades iof tenses, which in Samskrit behave like adjectives and 
so like nouns, are also thus derived. They are declined 
exactly like the nouns with which they may be in apposition : 



= seeing ( v. 8 ). 5jo^ hearing ( v. 8 ). 
being seated ( xiv. 23 ). fsipTPT = being slain ( ii. 20 ). 

%?T^: = to be heard ( ii. 52 ). gjrfozj = to be done (iii 22 ). 
gjTO = to be done ( xviii. 5 ). 

.= have ( or hast, or has ) said ( iv. 1 ). 

: = seized or possessed with ( i. 28 ). ffrfl: - devoted 
( ix. 31 ). *TTR: attached ( v. 12 ). 

: = going to fight ( i. 23 ). 



Many nouns are formed by inflectional modifications of 
other nouns : 

q-f^:, the son of jqT- ( ii. 3. ) 

e^f*:, the son of ^\. (ii. 14. ) 

So *tr*T? : from |J>TgT 5 ll^q: from ffa^t which itself is 
formed from yq-^ &c. ( i. 6. ). 

?($W; W3T, 3T?ifl: &c. meaning ' not capable of |jf :, 
or 3T?:, or ^fre: &c., ( ii. 24 ). 

good-ness : 

r = un-avaricious-ness ; ^rfrFTri^fr = very-proud 
ness; ( xiv. 2 ). 

-possessing ; ( vii. 18 ). 
d- 5 ( vii - 82 ). 
S?T. ( from r%) = ' from which ( place ), ( ii. 2 ) ; ^rf: 
from rfq;, then, thence,' ( vi. 45 ). 

Sf( : = ' in accordance with ^: ' ( ii. 31 ) ; 

3TST or eight ways ( vii. 4 ). &c., &c.> &c., 



[ xvii ] 

V. Sentences. The two main forms of the sentence 

are : ( 1 ) that in the active voice, and ( 2 ) that in the passive. 

( 1 ) Active : ^ HT 3Wfa feqfa ( iv. 14 )= Actions do not 

stain me. 

( 2 ) Passive : fozfo ^ QTqror ( v. 10 ) = He is not stained 

by sin. 

In construing a shloka the first thing to do is to separate 
out the words, so as to give to each its complete and independ- 
ent existence ; the coalesced tails and heads [ ^ffvj J are first 
dissolved into their component parts ; then the compound words 
are separated, and any lacking case-endings supplied; then 
the words are arranged in their prose order. In Samskrit 
order matters comparatively little, but still there is more 
inversion permissible in poetry than in prose. Let us 
take i. 2, 3.

THE BHAGAVAD-G!TA. 
THE GREATNESS OF THE GITA. 

Hail to Shrl Ganesha ! Hail to the Lover of 
Radhft ! 

Dhara (the Earth) said : O Blessed One, O Supreme 
Ruler, how may unfaltering devotion arise in him who 
is constrained by prarabdha karma, O Lord ? 

(i). Vishnu said : He who, constrained by prarab- 
dha karma, is ever assiduously practising the Gfta, he 
is liberated, he is happy in this world, he is not stained 
by karma. 

(2). If he study the Gita, then can no sin stain 
him, as water stains not the lotus-leaf. 

(3). Where is the book of the Gltft, where its read- 
ng is performed, there are all holy places, there indeed 
Prayaga and the rest. 



[ xxiv ] 

(4). All Devas, Rishis, Yogis and Pannagas, also 
Gopalas and Gopis also, with Narada, Uddhava, and 
their train. 

(5). Help comes swiftly where the GJti is recited. 
Where the discussion of the Gita, the recitation, the 
teaching, of it is heard, there I, O Earth, doubtless ever 
abide. 

(6). I dwell in the retreat of the Gita ; the Glta is 
My best abode. Having mastered the wisdom of the 
Glta, I protect the three worlds. 

(7). The Gitel is My supreme science, it is verily the 
form of Brahman. It is the half-syllable eternal (the 
dot on the 3*), everlasting, the ineffable essence of the 
Self, 

(8). Spoken by Krishna, the Omniscient, the 
Blessed, to Arjuna with His own mouth, the three Vedas, 
the final bliss, the exposition of the knowledge of the 
Tattvas. 

(9). The man who constantly repeats the eighteen 
discourses with unwavering mind, he will obtain perfect 
wisdom and reach the supreme goal. 

(10). If the complete recitation be impossible, then 
may one half be read. Then he doubtless obtains merit, 
equal to the gift of a cow. 

(ll). By the reading of a third part, he may obtain 



[ XXV ] 

the fruit of bathing in Ganga. By the repetition of a 
sixth part, he may obtain the fruit of the Soma-sacri- 
fice. 

(12). He who daily reads a single discourse with 
devotion, he, having become a Gaga, obtains Rudraloka 
and therein long abides. 

(13). The man who daily reads a quarter-shloka, 
he, O Earth, remains a man during a manvantara. 

(14). The man who should read ten, seven, five, 
four, two, three, one, or half a shloka of the Glta, 

(15). He securely obtains Chandraloka for ten 
thousand years. Ever engaged in the reading of the 
Glta, passing through death, he would return to hu- 
manity. 

(16). Having again practised the Glta, he obtains 
the supreme liberation. Engaged in the utterance, 
" Gita, " the dying reaches the path. 

(17). Attached to the hearing of the Glta, even the 
great sinner attains to Vaikuntha, and rejoices with 
Vishnu. 

(18). He who meditates on the meaning of the 
Glta, having performed actions abundantly, he should 
be known as a Jlvanmukta, and at the ending of the 
body reaches the supreme goal. 

(19). Having taken refuge in the Glta, many Kings, 



[ xxvi ] 

Janaka and the rest, praised in the world, being cleans- 
ed from sins, have gone to the supreme goal. 

(20). Having accomplished the reading of the Gita, 
he who should not also read this description of its 
greatness, his reading is in vain, and his labour is lost. 

(21). He who performs the practice of the Gita, 
associated with this discourse on its Greatness, he ob- 
tains the fruit, he may reach the path difficult of obtain- 
ment. 

(22). Suta said : He who should read this eternal 
Greatness of the Gita, proclaimed by me, at the end of the 
Gita, should obtain that fruit which has been described. 

(23). Thus in the blessed Varahapurana the great- 
ness of the Gita is set forth. 

Note. The statements made above, as to the value of reading portions, 
or the whole, of the Gftcl, may seem at first sight to be somewhat fantas- 
tic. They should not be construed as meaning the mere reading, the 
lip-repetition, of verses, but rather as the mastering and assimilation 
of the spirit of the GttA, and the life-repetition thereof. The man who 
has thus wrought the Gttd into his life is a Jivanmukta, and the assimila- 
tion of one shloka, of several, of a quarter of the Gftd, and so on, mark 
various stages in human evolution, each of which has its own appropriate 
fruit.

THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE HANDS ETC. 
FOR THE GfTA. 

3* The Blessed Veda-Vyasa is the Ri?hi of this 
Bkagavad-Gitb mantra. The metre is the anushtup. 
Shri Krishna, the Supreme Self, is its Devata. " Thou 
grievest for those that should not be grieved for, yet 
speakest words of wisdom : " such is the Blja. " Aban- 
doning all duties, come unto me alone for shelter : " such 
is the Shakti. " I will liberate thee from all sins ; 
sorrow not : " such is the Kilakam. " Weapons cleave 
him not, nor fire burneth him ; " thus : : - To the two 
thumbs, all hail ! " " Nor waters wet him, nor wind 
drieth him away ; " thus : " To the two index fingers, all 
hail ! " " Uncleavable he, incombustible he, neither to 
be wetted nor dried away ; " thus : " To the two middle 
fingers, all hail!" "Perpetual, all-pervasive, stable, im- 
movable, ancient ; " thus : " To the two nameless (fourth) 
fingers, all hail ! " " Behold, O Partha, my Forms,* a 
hundred-fold, a thousand-fold ; " thus : " To the two little 
fingers, all hail ! " " Various in kind, divine, various in 
colours ; " thus : " To the two palms and backs of the 



[ xxix ] 

hands, all hail ! " Such is the disposition of the hands. 
Now as to the disposition of the heart and the other 
organs. " Weapons cleave him not, nor fire burneth 
him;" thus: "To the heart, all hail !" "Nor waters wet 
him, nor wind drieth him away;" thus: "To the head, 
svaha ! " Uncleavable he, incombustible he, neither to be 
wetted nor dried away ; " thus: " To the shikha, vashat ! " 
i( Perpetual, all-pervasive, stable, immovable ;" thus: " To 
the encasement, hun ! " " Behold, O Partha, my Forms, 
a hundred-fold, a thousand-fold ;" thus : " To the fire- 
weapon, phat ! " For the propitiation of Shri Krishna the 
reading is enjoined. 

Note . A mantra, in the Hindu religion, has a Rishi, who gave it ; 
A metre, which governs the inflection of the voice. A Devatft a super* 
natural being, higher or lower as its informing power. The Blja, seed, 
is a significant word, or series of words, which gives it a special power ; 
sometimes this word is a sound which harmonises with the key-note of 
the individual using it, and varies with the individual ; sometimes this 
word expresses the essence of the mantra, and the result of the mantra 
is the flower springing from this seed ; this essence of the Gttd is in the 
words quoted. The Shakti is the energy of the form of the mantra, i. e. 
the vibration-forms set up by its sounds ; these in the Gftd carry the man 
to the Lord. The Kilakam, the pillar, is that which supports and makes 
strong the mantra ; this is the ceasing of sorrow, by the freeing from 
imperfections. 

Then follow certain special directions, intended to set up 
relations between the centres in the man's body and the corresponding 
centres in the body of the Lord the universe. The thumbs, the earth- 
symbol, are connected with the physical plane t and are utilised in con- 
trol of its subtle forces. The index fingers, the water-symbol, are con- 



[ XXX ] 

nected with the astral plane, and are similarly used with astral forces. 
The middle fingers, the fire-symbol, the apex of the pyramid of the hand, 
are similarly used with mental forces. The fourth fingers, the air-symbol, 
are similarly used with buddhic forces. The little fineers, the most 
powerful in the subtle worlds, are the 4kasha-symbol, and are similarly 
used with atmic forces. The other organs of the body are the other 
poles of the magnet of the body : thumbs and heart; index fingers and 
head ; middle fingers and the point of juncture of the occipital and 
parietal sutures ; the fourth fingers and the sukshma sharira ; the little 
fingers and the creative organ. These are the positive and negative poles 
of the magnet we call the body ; either may be positive, either negative, 
according to the object aimed at, but they work together. 

From other stand-points, these dispositions may be regarded as 
having on the one hand, an inhibitory, or, on the other, a stimulative 
effect on the physical or subtler function of the organs concerned, 
according to the purpose in view in the subsequent meditation or 
practice. 

To the western world these correspondences may seem fantastic and 
superstitious ; to the eastern world, in which the faint tradition of the 
Great Science lingers, they sound as echoes of a mightier age, when 
Gods and Men walked familiarly together in the Hidden Ways.

THE MEDITATION ON GiTA. 

3% Taught by the Blessed N^rSyana Himself to 
Arjuna ; compiled by Vyasa, the ancient Muni, in the 
midst of the Mahdbhdrata; I meditate on thee, O Mother, 
O Bhagavad-Gita, the blessed, the pourer- forth of the 
nectar of Advaita, destroyer of rebirth. Hail to thee, 
O Vyasa, large-minded one, with eyes like the petals 
of the opened lotus ; by whom the lamp of knowledge, 
filled with the oil of the Mahdbhdrata, has been lighted. 
To the Parijata-kalpataru of the suppliant, to the holder of 
the whip, to Krishna as Teacher, milker of the Gita-nec- 
tar, all hail ! All the Upanisjiats are the cows ; the Milker 
is the joy of the cowherds ; Partha is the calf; the man 
of high intelligence is the enjoyer ; the milk is the great 
nectar of the Gita. I worship Vasudeva, the charioteer, 
the God, the destroyer of Kamsa and Chanura, the supreme 
joy of Devaki, Kris, hna, Guru of the world. With Keshava 
as helmsman, verily was crossed by the Pandavas that 



[ xxxiii ] 

battle- river, whose banks were Bhishma and Drona, 
whose water was Jayadratha, whose blue lotus was 
GandhSra, whose crocodile wasShalya, whose current was 
Kripa, whose billows were Karna, whose terrible alligators 
were Asvatthama and Vikarna, whose whirlpool was 
Duryodhana. May this Lotus of the Mahdbhamta be 
for our good, born on the lake of the words of P^r^sh- 
arya, sweet with the fragrance of the meaning of the 
Git, pollened with many stories, unfolding to the sun 
of the history of Hari, sucked by the bees of good men 
in the world day by day, cleanser of the stains of Kali. 
I salute Him, Madhava, the supreme Bliss, whose grace 
makes the dumb man eloquent, and the cripple a climber 
of mountains. Whom Brahma, Varuna, Indra, Rudra, 
and the Maruts praise with divine songs; whom the 
SSma-chanters sing with the Vedas and with Ahgas, in 
the pada and krama methods with the Upanihats; 
whom Yogis see by the mind fixed in meditation, to 
Him going ; whose end Suras and Asuras know not; 
to that God, all hail !

APPENDIX. 

The following variations of the text and one or two new inter- 
-pretations are printed as likely to be of use to the student. The 
different readings have been mostly gathered together by B&bu 
Govinda D&sa of Benares from various MSS. and different com- 
mentaries. The new interpretations have been suggested by Pandit 
Vrindavana SArasvata of Benares, who passed away only in this 
year (1905 A. D.). The interpretations are worthy of attention 
because of their prima Jade aptness. This gentleman used to say 
that he had practically studied only two works in the course of a 
fairly long life, the Bhagavad-Qita and the Yoga-Vasishtha ; and 
the kind of study he gave to these may be inferred from the fact 
that, as he said shortly before his death, he had read the Yoffa- 
Vastshtha through one-hundred and sixty-five times and the 
work consists of sixty-four thousand lines-while the OttA was read 
through too often to be counted. Under these circumstances it 
is easy to see that his interpretations are at least as notable as 
many older ones.

FOR READ REMARKS. 

i. 8. f&f ^T 444gi|: Adds the name of one of 

the principal warriors. 

i. 10. ^5T *0*nf*r- <J*|frrfa- Dhrishtadyumna was the 

^f^?T ^f%IT Commander-in-chief of the 

PAndava army. 

i. 19. s*3- s>*3 The prefix ft has no 

special significance here, 
while ?rfSr gives the sense 
of "on all sides." 

i. 36. VHKN^I"! ^^fw^l'i The alternative here is 

scarcely preferable, as it 
means ' with tLeir rela- 
tions '; the text, on the 
other hand, ' our own rela- 
tives', is stronger. 

4 $i "Not thus" (shouldst 

thou grieve, even so). 



ii. 53. Jgfrtf^rafrHSri Pt. Vrindivana interprets this as meaning: 

, " having, 



by listening (to my teaching) acquired knowledge of 
the true and particular significance of the Veda". 
ii. 62. *5nft 5TPT: This is an emendation 

ii. 63. lifreni ^*TT<1 suggested by Pandit Viin-^ 

davana. on the ground 
that anger does not arise 
from desire but from defeat 



[ 33i ] 

of desire, while pjfa 1 , blind 
craving, is the natural con- 
sequence of desire. The 
emendation has a doubtful 
value, however, because it 
is not supported by any 
manuscripts inspected, and 
the addition of " defeat of " 
is no very serious strain on 
the interpretation of the 
verse. 

iv. 23. iTffTO 3TR* The context refers to one 

who is still striving after 
deliverance, g^*q, and not 
to one who has already 
attained it, grK?q. 

v. 21. K^ *: !J*T In view of the following 

?n, q: is distinctly the 
better reading grammati- 
cally ; sj?f confuses the prose 
order and the sense, and 
does not fit in. 

The alternative is correct 
according to modern gram- 
mar, and the other incorrect, 
because CTfra, with which 
the pronoun is in apposition, 
is masculine and not neuter, 



[ 332 ] 

vii. 19. gjpbr: lET 1$*T : "He is difficult to find" 

instead of " very difficult 
to find ". 

viii. 5. 3re*ET3 WfaW The text means " un- 

doubtedly "; the alterna- 
tive " free of doubt thy- 
self ". The text seems to 
be the stronger reading. 

viii. 8. <r||fi|i|rprTf STRTTrf^Tr The alternative makes no 

change of meaning, but is 
more in accordance with 
modern grammar. 

viii. 20. SS^rRt eZRtHl ^TfrfS^TCTfl " (More ancient) than 

both the manifested and the 
(lower) unmanifested." Of. 
xv. 16 & 18, xi. 37. 

x. 7. sf?Ni<T?f SfteR5*iT The alternative means 

" abstract, without Vikalpa, 
without alternative, doubt, 
or lower attraction ". It is 
more in keeping with the 
technicality of Yoga. 

xi. 28. 9Tf*rR5^t$f% STRTrft 5^?5Kr " Flaming on all sides." 

The alternative seems to 
make better sense. The text 
has a superfluous and weak 
prefix ft. 

xi. 41. ft ?Hl. The alternative is gramma- 



[ 333 ] 

tically correct, as the 

which the pronoun qualifies 

is masculine, not neuter. 

xiii. 5. ^ItqrftHL here is interpreted by Pt. VrincUvana as 

meaning the Linga Sharlra. 

xiv. 1. snfRf STTRsri "(The highest knowledge) 

of the wise '* instead of " of 
all knowledges ". 

xiv. 3. 4. In these two shlokas, the current commentaries 
interpret the word HfJJ as ' great ' and regard it as 
qualifying myf, Brahman ; and further they construe 
both the shlokas as meaning that "the great Brahman 
is the womb and I the depositor of the seed". 
Pt. VrindAvana says the construction should be as 
follows : " mahat-tattva is the womb and I, Brahman, 
am the seed-giver ''. 

xv. 23. ireRrenf M4fg8frT " And acts in pursuance." 

This gives additional mean- 
ing ; the other merely re- 
peats the sense of 5t*Tft. 

xvii. 23. HT&PTreN WSPrr %T " By that Brahma, or by 

that Brahman." Cf. iv. 32.
